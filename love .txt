Love and Happy meet Joy
Is it a feeling?
Is it an emotion?
It goes up
When happy is around 
It goes down
When happy leaves town 
But it's constantly around 
Sadness is never around
What is love?
Who determains the measurmenets? 
Joy joins the group 
She picks shines bright despite 
Love and Happy not being alright 
The list of emotions are long
Only the positive ones can enetr though
